I first got the tables and the database setup. I made sure I had all the columns that were needed for the 4 tables were made along with setting up the primary keys and foreign key. After maing each table I would test to make sure it worked and popped up in the database to avoid problems later.

Screenshot below is of the start of making the database itself and one of the tables.

Filled in the data for each table today except for the sales contract table. I also made some of the queries for getting all the dealerships, find all vehicles for a specific dealership and find a car by VIN. For the find a car by VIN I made 2 sepearte queries where you can search both the inventory and the vehicles tables. Tested to make sure they worked along with making sure the data I made also was put in properly. I also made folders to organize the database and queries to make it easier to find what your looking for and wanting to run.

Picture below is of the query that looks up the car by VIN.
